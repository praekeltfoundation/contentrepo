# KB1 - Multiple Parents Error on Import

## Issue Summary

This error occurs when the import system finds multiple parent pages with the same title and locale but different slugs. The system cannot determine which parent to use, preventing the import from proceeding.

## When This Error Occurs

### Scenario 1: Multiple Parents Already in Database

The database already contains 2+ pages with the same title and locale but different slugs.

**Example:**
- Database has: `title='Onboarding'`, `slug='onboarding_v1'`, `locale='English'`
- Database has: `title='Onboarding'`, `slug='onboarding_v2'`, `locale='English'`
- Import file references parent: `title='Onboarding'`, `locale='English'`

**Error message shows:**
```
Database: ['onboarding_v1', 'onboarding_v2']
```

**Resolution - Option A: Delete Incorrect Parent**

If one parent is incorrect or unused:
1. Delete the incorrect parent from database (ensure no child pages depend on it)
2. Re-run the import

**Resolution - Option B: Rename One Parent**

If both parents are valid but need to be distinct:
1. Rename one parent's title to make it unique (e.g., 'Onboarding V1', 'Onboarding V2')
2. Update your import file to reference the correct parent title
3. Re-run the import

### Scenario 2: Parent in Both Import and Database with Different Slugs

Your import file contains a parent page with the same title+locale as a database page, but different slug.

**Example:**
- Database has: `title='Onboarding'`, `slug='mnch_functional_copy_onboarding'`, `locale='English'`
- Import has: `title='Onboarding'`, `slug='onboarding'`, `locale='English'`
- Import also has child page referencing parent: `title='Onboarding'`

**Error message shows:**
```
Import: ['onboarding']
Database: ['mnch_functional_copy_onboarding']
```

**Resolution - Option A: Update Existing Parent**

If you want to update the database parent:
1. Change the slug in your import file to match the database
   - Change from `'onboarding'` to `'mnch_functional_copy_onboarding'`
2. Re-run the import

**Resolution - Option B: Create New Parent**

If you want to create a new separate parent:
1. Change the title in your import file to make it unique
   - Change to `'Onboarding - New'` or similar
2. OR change the locale to a different language
3. Re-run the import

## Technical Background

The import system uses **title + locale** to find parent pages. When multiple pages match, it cannot determine which is correct. Parent pages must have unique **title+locale+slug** combinations across both Database and Import.

## Prevention

1. Use unique titles for parent pages within each locale
2. Before importing, check existing parent slugs in the database
3. When updating existing parents, use the exact slug from the database
